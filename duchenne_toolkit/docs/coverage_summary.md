# Duchenne Care Access Coverage Summary

**Run date:** 2025-08-24


## Methods

We compiled a list of certified Duchenne care centers from Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD) announcements through mid‑2025【681332876136906†L380-L465】【483110723608113†L430-L440】【133955900796891†L7-L21】.  County‑level male population counts for ages 5–24 were derived from the National Center for Health Statistics bridged‑race population estimates (2010s) contained in a local dataset; we averaged male counts across all available reference years for each county and five‑year age band (5–9, 10–14, 15–19 and 20–24) to approximate a five‑year estimate.  Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy prevalence (1.3–1.8 per 10 000 males) from MD STARnet was multiplied by 0.75 to approximate Duchenne only【514519091151079†L144-L147】, and a diagnosed Duchenne prevalence of 6 per 100 000 males was used as a secondary anchor.  Low, mid and high estimates were derived from these rates by taking the minimum, mean and maximum of the two approaches.  Straight‑line distances from county population‑weighted centroids (from a public county centers dataset) to the nearest care center were calculated using the haversine formula to classify counties into ≤150, 150–300 and >300 mile bands; drive times were approximated assuming a 50 mph average speed.

## Limitations

This analysis assumes patients reside at the population‐weighted centroid of their county and that all certified centers have equal capacity.  Drive times are approximated from straight‐line distances and may not reflect actual travel times.  Prevalence rates are estimates and do not account for regional variation; adult transitions beyond age 24 are not modeled.  Data sources and certifications are current through mid‑2025 but may change thereafter.
